            <p>Hi, I'm Geordie! My real name is George Washington Connell but there were so many Georges in my family
                so my parents gave me a nickname.

            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>I am currently in a student in the Engineering Immersion Boot Camp at Thinkful. I love programming because I love the
            incredible feeling when my code comes to life on screen. The ever-expanding number libraries and systems to learn
            satisfies my constant desire to continue learning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have a BS in Statistics from Lehigh University and have previous experiences in the financial services industry working
                in client relations and sales. If you're looking for an articulate analytical mind, 
                <a href="mailto:geordie.connell@gmail.com"> send me an email!</a>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>When I’m not programming, I’m using either playing, watching, or talking about sports. I play in a number of intermural sports leagues
            in Philadelphia as well as at least one round of golf on weekends. I also host a podcast called the Bullpen Cart 
            where my friends and I talk baseball, football, hockey, and plenty of other sports. Nothing makes me happier than 
            watching the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park on a warm summer night with a cold beer in my hands.

            <h3>Sports Trivia Quiz</h3>
            <p>If you couldn’t tell from my bio, I’m a big sports fan. With that fandom, comes a lot of random knowledge so we decided
            to put some of it to good use! We used JQuery to render each of our questions and answers as well as a conditional
            results screen that loads different statuses depending on your score. The app has eight questions in its question bank
            and will randomly select five for the user to answer.</p>
            <p>Can you reach Hall of Fame status like Michael Strahan? Try the quiz for yourself!</p>
            <p><b>Built Using:</b> HTML5, CSS, JQuery</p>
